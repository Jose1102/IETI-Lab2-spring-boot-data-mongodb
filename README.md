## Spring Boot Data with MongoDB

**Learning Objectives**

- Explain what MongoDB is .
- Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL.
- Create a MongoDB Cluster on Atlas.
- Connect your Spring Boot project with a MongoDB Cluster.


## Detail Orientation ü§πüèΩ

Read the following document [Attention to details](https://www.csu.edu/humanresources/empdev/documents/AttentiontoDetail.pdf) 

**Main Topics**

* NoSQL.
* MongoDB.
* Cluster.



## Codelab üß™

* GET method is performed that returns all users
